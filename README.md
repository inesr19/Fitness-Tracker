# Fitness Tracker

## Description
The purpose of this application is to allow the user to view, create, and track daily workouts. The user can log multiple workouts during a given day and enter the amount of reps, sets, and/or distance that was completed. This app also allows weight input for corresponding resistance workouts and the duration it took to complete each workout. Users can go to the stats page to view the amount of weight they used and the total duration of all their workouts from the past seven days.
